# NeuralNet_GestureClassification
### Implementation of Neural Network for gesture classification

Program takes gesture samples as input and trains neural network to classify that samples<br/>
(**e.g.** if there are total of **three** gestures, it will classify **first gesture as 100**, **second as 010** and **third as 001**

<br/>

### Example
In the picutres below, classification of first five letter of greek alphabet is shown.
